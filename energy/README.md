## Project description

This hobby project aims to create a data extraction system that uses the free Electricity API to retrieve current carbon emissions and energy consumption data. The system updates the data every hour and stores it in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud service after transformation. The data processing and transformation are done in Python, while Power BI is used for data visualization.
