## Busines Central app tranlation script


This Python script helps speed up the preparation of translations. The translation is performed by the GPT 4o model via an API call. To use it, registration and an API key are required at OpenAI. However, the use of the API is not free, you can find out about the prices on the OpenAI website. According to my experience, a Japanese translation takes approx. It cost $1 per 600 requests. The language to be translated must be specified in the "system_pormpt" variable. The quality of the translation can be improved by refining the prompt. Note that GPT can be wrong, so check the translation before final build!
